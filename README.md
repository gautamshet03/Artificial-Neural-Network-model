# ANN with one hidden layer and one formal neuron trained using backpropagation algorithm

A neuron in a neural network adds up the inputs it receives, adjusts them with some weights and a bias, then applies a function to produce an output. This output is compared to the actual value, and the weights and bias are tweaked to make the output closer to the real one. It's like adjusting a recipe to make the perfect cake: you keep changing the ingredients until you get it just right.

This aims to explain the backpropagation algorithm in a simple manner, focusing on a neural network with one hidden layer and one neuron, similar to feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Unlike classification problems where the sigmoid function is often used, for multilinear regression like the one discussed here, the sigmoid function isn't ideal because it produces values between 0 and 1. In regression, the identity function or another linear function works better for optimizing parameters. Backpropagation, in this context, yields results akin to multilinear regression using least squares. However, achieving model convergence requires precise adjustment of the learning rate, which is typically the key parameter to tune during network training.

Imagine you're trying to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and other factors. To do this, you use a neural network with one hidden layer and one neuron.

The backpropagation algorithm is like a recipe for teaching the neural network how to make better predictions. Here's how it works:

# Setup
You start with some initial guesses for how important each factor (like size and number of bedrooms) is in predicting the house price. These guesses are represented by weights and biases.

# Prediction
You use these initial guesses to make a prediction about the house price. But because your guesses are just that guesses your prediction is probably not very accurate.

# Feedback
You compare your prediction to the actual house price. This difference is your error.

# Learning
Now, you go back and tweak your initial guesses to reduce the error. The backpropagation algorithm helps you figure out which tweaks will make the biggest improvement.

# Repeat
You keep repeating this process making predictions, comparing them to reality, and adjusting your guesses until your predictions are pretty close to the actual house prices.

The key thing to remember is that the backpropagation algorithm is like a coach helping the neural network learn from its mistakes and get better at predicting house prices. And just like a coach, it's all about practice repeating the process over and over until you get it right.
